## Introduction

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment generator for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

The main idea behind this tool is to have an automatic way to generate [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) environments for development, but also for production. To support this, [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) has been included to the tech stack, enabling SSL termination and simplifying the generation of SSL certificates for live sites.

It is worth mentioning that this tool was inspired by the following excellent project that achieves similar goals:

- [Next.js Self Hosting Example](https://github.com/leerob/next-self-host)
