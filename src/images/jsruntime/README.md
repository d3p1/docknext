# [JAVASCRIPT RUNTIME]

</div>

## Introduction

A [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) runtime image that has both [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en) and [`bun`](https://bun.com/). This image was implemented for the [docknext](https://github.com/d3p1/docknext) project, but it can be used in any environment.

> [!NOTE]
> The tag format works as follows: `n{nodeversion}-b{bunversion}`. There is also a `{tag}-dev` that tags dev versions (adds useful tools for development environments).
