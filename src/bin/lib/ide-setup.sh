# @description Docknext command to setup an IDE to work with
#              this Next.js environment
# @author      C. M. de Picciotto <d3p1@d3p1.dev> (https://d3p1.dev/)
# @note        It was considered whether the logic of this command could be
#              integrated into one of the existing commands (e.g.,
#              `docknext init`, `docknext next-install`, or
#              `docknext next-setup`), but the best approach was to make it
#              an independent command.
#              Setting up the IDE is necessary for both
#              new Next.js installations (`docknext next-install`)
#              as well as for
#              already existing installations (`docknext next-setup`),
#              but the platform's source code must already be present to apply
#              the required IDE configurations.
#              Additionally, it's understood that this command will primarily
#              be needed for development environments,
#              but no validation is performed for this (e.g.,
#              checking the value of the `SCRIPT_MODE` variable)
#              to provide greater flexibility and allow it to be run
#              whenever deemed necessary
