# @description Profile file to setup environment variables that will be used
#              by `docknext` to initialize/setup the Docker environment
# @author      C. M. de Picciotto <d3p1@d3p1.dev> (https://d3p1.dev/)
# @note        If you would like to run the CLI for a production environment,
#              use `production` value for `SCRIPT_MODE`.
#              If you would like to run the CLI for a development environment,
#              use `development` value for `SCRIPT_MODE`
# @note        The `SCRIPT_DOC_ROOT_DIR` must point to the local
#              app source code.
#              It is required for development environments to
#              work with the platform code locally, and also
#              for production environments so the `docknext next-setup`
#              knows the location of the platform code that should be
#              copy to the service/container
# @note        The `SCRIPT_IDE_KEY` must be set to one of the
#              following values: `webstorm`, `vscode`, or an empty string ("").
#              If set to `webstorm` or `vscode`, configuration files related to
#              the corresponding IDE will be deployed inside
#              `SCRIPT_DOC_ROOT_DIR` to facilitate the initialization
#              of the working environment
