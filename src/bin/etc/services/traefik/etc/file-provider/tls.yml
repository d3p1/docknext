# @note Add certificates to enable SSL connection
# @note This configuration is useful to create certificates 
#       for development environment
# @note Create certificates using `mkcert` and move them to the `../certs`
#       directory. The files could have any name, like `next.crt` and
#       `next.key`.
#       i.e., if it is required to create 
#       a certificate for the `next.test` domain, it is possible to execute:
#       `mkcert \
#        -key-file next.key \
#        -cert-file next.crt \
#        next.test *.next.test`
# @note Traefik searches through all its certificates
#       when it receives a request for a specific domain. If one of its
#       certificates matches the requested domain,
#       an SSL connection is established
